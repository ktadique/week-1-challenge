# Challenge 1 - Horiseon Marketing Webpage Refactoring

## Description

This repository is where I refactored the existing source code of the [Horiseon Marketing Agency](https://ktadique.github.io/week-1-challenge/) website in order to make it more accessible, especially for those who use assitive technologies, as well as making the website better optimized for search engines.

This was done by ensuring that:

- Semtantic HTML and HTML elements were used and formatted correctly through out the sourcecode.
- All images and icons contain the 'alt' attribute
-
