# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task

**Note**: Be sure to review the [Challenge Guide](./Challenge-Guide.md) and the [Good README Guide](./Good-README-Guide.md) before you start working on this assignment!

This week your challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's challenge requirements:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources:

- [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

### Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

# Week 1 - Horiseon Marketing Webpage Refactoring

## Description

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

---

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
